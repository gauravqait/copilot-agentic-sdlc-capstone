# Pre-Step Hook

**Event:** Before each SDLC agent stage.

**Purpose:** Confirm the stage can start safely.

**Checks:**
- Verify the current Jira story key and `docs/<story-id>/` context.
- Verify the preceding stage artifact exists and is explicitly `approved`.
- Verify the requested stage matches the configured `00-08` sequence.
- Verify the expected predecessor and output paths are derived from the same story ID; never accept caller-supplied paths outside `docs/<story-id>/`.
- Load only the minimum approved context required by the stage.

**Block when:** The predecessor is missing, unapproved, rejected, blocked, or out of order.

**Output:** Stage name, story ID, input artifact, and `ready` or `blocked` status.

**Recovery:** A blocked pre-step leaves `docs/pipeline-state.json` unchanged and records the missing or invalid prerequisite in the run result.

**Flow:** 
KAN-4 exists?
Previous stage approved?
pipeline-state.json exists?
If no → Stop.
