# Post-Step Hook

**Event:** After each approved SDLC agent stage.

**Purpose:** Close the stage and prepare an efficient handoff.

**Checks:**
- Persist the stage status, artifact path, decision, evidence, and risks.
- Append exactly one history entry after approval; repeated execution must not duplicate an identical entry.
- Identify the next ordered agent and required input artifact.

**Block when:** The stage artifact or approval evidence cannot be persisted.

**Output:** Completed stage summary and next-agent handoff context.

**Recovery:** If state persistence fails, leave the previous state and approval gate intact for retry.

**Flow:**
Update docs/<story-id>/pipeline-state.json
